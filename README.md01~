Project: Pig Game

Concept: To create a game that consists of 2 players that each roll a dice. 
Every roll adds to player's total until the player rolls a 1.
Program then switches to the other player. Game runs until someone hits 100.


Functionality: 3 separate buttons: Roll, Hold, New
Roll - allows the player to roll #1-6
Hold - stores value and adds to overall score
New - resets game and all values

Logic: 
-Start off with defining variables
-Add event listeners to each button
(
    btnroll: will generate a random number 1-6
    number > 1 will + to current score
    number = 1 will switch to next player

    create switch player function to toggle to player 2. 
    btnroll will repeat

    btnhold: will store the currentscore to player's overall score

    Game repeats until someone reaches 100

    btnNew: resets game
    create function to initialize game
    reset all values to 0
)
-Test for any bugs
